    <h1>About Engineering Business Group</h1>
    <p><strong>The Engineering Business Group (EBG)</strong> was founded in 2025 by University of Michigan students Jack Stevens and Henry Westphal, two engineering majors with a shared interest in applying technical knowledge to business-focused careers in consulting, sales, and entrepreneurship.</p>

    <p>Recognizing a gap in opportunities that combined both disciplines, they created EBG as a space for students to build the skills and experience necessary to thrive at the intersection of engineering and business.</p>

    <p>At its core, EBG empowers students to explore careers that blend innovation with strategy, whether that means becoming a technical consultant, launching a startup, or driving sales in a tech-focused company. We help business students gain technical literacy, and give engineering students the communication, leadership, and analytical tools they need to succeed in client-facing or business-development roles.</p>

    <p><strong>What we offer:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Educational workshops on technical sales, consulting, product development, and more</li>
      <li>Hands-on projects that simulate real-world business and engineering collaboration</li>
      <li>Case competitions and internal challenges that promote creative problem solving</li>
      <li>Networking opportunities with industry professionals and student peers</li>
      <li>Career exploration to help members find their own niche and path forward</li>
    </ul>

    <p>EBG is open to <em>all majors and experience levels</em>. Whether you’re a seasoned builder, an aspiring entrepreneur, or just curious about how technical innovation drives business success, you’ll find a welcoming and ambitious community here.</p>

    <p>As a brand-new organization, we’re actively expanding; building our network, launching new initiatives, and connecting with professionals across industries. Our mission is simple: to create a collaborative, inclusive environment where students can turn their curiosity into career readiness.</p>
